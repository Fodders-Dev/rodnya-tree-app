# Message-send speed — how to measure (and the SPEED-6 gate)

SPEED-1..5 are shipped (backend live; client in 1.0.26+34 via OTA). SPEED-6 (move
messages out of the whole-document JSONB into an append-only `chat_messages` table,
send = INSERT) is the only remaining structural item — a **prod-DB data migration,
not fully testable locally**. Decision rule: **do it only if real numbers still fall
short after 1–5.** Instrumentation is already in the code; here's how to read it.

## MEASURED 2026-07-13 on a real device (Galaxy S20 FE, 1.0.26+34) — the gate is TRIPPED, but not where we assumed

Numbers (single message, no backlog; smoke-test chat):
- **client `tap-to-bubble` ~26 ms** — optimistic UI works; the bubble is instant regardless of the server.
- **client `send-to-ack` ~2.5 s** — the ✓ takes ~2.5 s even for one message; worse (4–5 s, climbing) under rapid fire.
- **server split:** `access ~830 ms` + `persist ~1580 ms` = `ack ~2360 ms`. Almost the entire wait is server-side.

**Root cause — not network, not client, not "chat too big":** the ENTIRE app is stored as
ONE Postgres row / ONE JSONB blob (`public.rodnya_state`, `id='default'`), measured at
**8.0 MB**. Every write reads+parses the whole 8 MB (the access-check reads it once,
then `_mutate` reads it again), appends, and rewrites all 8 MB — and the global
`_mutateQueue` serializes every write app-wide. So `persist` is `O(total app size)`,
not `O(this message)`.

**Blob breakdown (why scoped SPEED-6 alone barely helps):**
| key | size | note |
|---|---|---|
| `treeChangeRecords` | 3.5 MB (43%) | tree + profile-article HISTORY (feature-backing; retention-trim, don't drop) |
| `graphPersons` | 617 KB | |
| `pushDeliveries` | 608 KB | delivery telemetry — pure log, prunable |
| `calls` | 570 KB | call log — prunable/cappable |
| `deletedPersons` | 529 KB | tombstones |
| `notifications` | 426 KB | high-churn |
| **`messages`** | **372 KB (4.5%)** | the actual chat messages |

**Messages are only 4.5% of the blob** — moving *just* messages into their own table
would remove almost none of the 3–4 s. The persist cost is dominated by the unbounded
history/log collections, above all `treeChangeRecords`. And even a messages table won't
fix send speed alone, because the **access-check (~830 ms) also reads the whole blob**
to verify chat membership — chat metadata must leave the blob too, or be cached.

**Fix path (proper > cheap):**
1. **Retention hygiene (own-right correctness) — SHIPPED 2026-07-13.** `_sweepUnboundedLogs`
   in the daily `hardDeleteExpired` job caps/TTL-prunes the unbounded collections:
   `pushDeliveries` (>7d), `calls` (terminal >24h; busy never touched), `notifications`
   (silent >48h / read >30d / unread >365d), and strips `before/after/mergedFrom` snapshots
   from non-article `treeChangeRecords` >30d (record kept; client history never reads them).
   The job was also routed through `_mutate` (was raw `_read/_write` → lost-update race).
2. **Structural fix (Telegram-grade `ack`, deferred).** To get `ack` under ~300 ms you must
   take the hot-write collections out of the single blob into their own indexed tables —
   messages (send = INSERT) AND the chat membership/metadata read for the access-check, then
   the big logs. Staged, deploy-gated, not fully testable locally. SPEED-6 generalized.

### PROVEN RESULT — one-time prune on prod (2026-07-13)
A dry-run then live one-shot of the sweep on the prod blob removed 263 terminal calls,
1378 push deliveries, 464 old notifications (0 unread touched), and stripped 1757
tree-change snapshots. Re-measured on the same device:

| metric | before | after | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| blob size | 8.0 MB | 4.8 MB | −40% |
| server `access` | ~830 ms | ~470 ms | −43% |
| server `persist` | ~1580 ms | ~940 ms | −40% |
| client send-to-ack | ~2500 ms | ~1500 ms | −40% |
| tap-to-bubble | ~26 ms | ~28 ms | unchanged (optimistic UI) |

The proportional drop confirms persist is `O(blob size)`. The daily job keeps it trimmed
and keeps stripping `treeChangeRecords` as they age past 30d. tap-to-bubble was already
instant (optimistic UI) — the ~1.5 s that remains is the whole-blob rewrite, which only the
structural fix (step 2) removes.

The generic how-to-measure notes below still apply for re-checking after each step.

## Client — tap → bubble (target: <16 ms = one frame)
`PerfTrace('chat.tap-to-bubble')` in `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart` fires from the
send tap to the first frame with the optimistic bubble. In a debug/profile build,
`flutter logs` (or `adb logcat | grep '\[perf\]'`) shows:
```
[perf] chat.tap-to-bubble: 8ms
```
- <16 ms → the "Telegram instant" feel is achieved (SPEED-1 did this). This number is
  network-independent, so it should already be tiny. If it isn't, that's a client
  jank bug, NOT a reason for SPEED-6.

## Client — tap → ack (the «часики → галочка», network-bound)
`PerfTrace('chat.send-to-ack')` (already existed) logs the full round-trip:
```
[perf] chat.send-to-ack: 180ms
```
- Target p50 <300 ms, p95 <800 ms on mobile data (Nielsen/RAIL + RU-RTT ~20–80 ms).
  SPEED-2/3/4 attack this. If p95 is comfortably under target → **SPEED-6 not needed.**

## Server — where the ack ms go
Every send logs a grep-able line (`ssh` to prod, `journalctl -u rodnya-backend -f` or
the app log), split into phases:
```
[send-timing] chat=<id> access=<ms> persist=<ms> ack=<ms> dedup=false
[send-timing] chat=<id> fanout=<ms> recipients=<n>
```
- `ack` = time to the sender's 200 (auth + access read + persist). This is what the
  user feels. `fanout` runs AFTER the ack (backgrounded) — it does NOT delay the user.
- **The SPEED-6 signal:** watch `persist`. Today it's a whole-document read-modify-write,
  so it grows with total chat history and serializes under concurrent senders (the
  global `_mutateQueue`). If `persist` is a few ms and flat → the JSONB store is fine at
  this scale, **skip SPEED-6.** If `persist` climbs into tens/hundreds of ms as history
  grows, or `ack` p95 balloons when several people send at once → **that's the trigger**
  to build SPEED-6.

## How to sample honestly
1. On a real RuStore-installed device (not emulator), send ~20 messages fast in a busy
   group chat; collect `chat.send-to-ack` p50/p95 from `[perf]` logs.
2. On the server, grep `[send-timing]` over the same burst; note `persist` and whether
   `ack` inflates under the concurrent senders.
3. Repeat once the chat has a large history (the JSONB store degrades with size).

If both client p95 and server `persist` stay under target across those → **1–5 already
delivered Telegram-grade send speed; SPEED-6 is premature optimization.** If not, build
SPEED-6 on a branch (PostgresStore overrides for addChatMessage + message reads +
markDelivered + unread + reactions + search + a JSONB→table migration; dedup on
(chatId, senderId, clientMessageId)); merge = deploy only on an explicit go, with prod
validation — it can't be fully proven locally (postgres-store tests run on a mock).
